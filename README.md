This project was designed to facilitate spelling skill improvement through interactive practice sessions. Developed using Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit, it presents a focused learning environment with a clean, dark-themed user interface.

Key Functionalities:

Curated Word Lists: The application includes several pre-defined word lists categorized by difficulty and subject matter. These encompass commonly misspelled English words, beginner and advanced vocabulary sets, as well as specialized glossaries relevant to Technology, Command-Line Interfaces (CLI), and CCNA networking concepts.

Auditory Pronunciation: Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality articulates the target spelling word using the system's default TTS engine. Typically, the word is pronounced twice with a brief intervening pause to aid comprehension.

Interactive Spelling Input: Users are prompted to input their spelling attempt after hearing the word. The application provides immediate visual feedback, indicating whether the submission was correct or incorrect, and displays the accurate spelling if an error was made.

Randomized Word Presentation: Words within the selected list are presented in a randomized sequence. This methodology encourages genuine recall and discourages rote memorization based on list order.

Contextual Hint System: A hint feature is available to assist users with particularly challenging words. Hints may include information such as word length, initial and final letters, or warnings about potential orthographic pitfalls (e.g., double consonants, specific vowel combinations).

Error Tracking: The application automatically logs words that are misspelled during a practice session, compiling a list for user review.

Session Persistence: Users have the option to save their session's list of misspelled words, including basic attempt statistics, to a persistent JSON file. This allows for resuming targeted practice at a later time by reloading the saved data.

Targeted Remediation: A dedicated "Practice Misspelled" mode enables users to focus exclusively on the words previously identified as difficult from the currently loaded or tracked misspelled list.

Interface Adjustability: Font sizes throughout the application interface can be increased or decreased to optimize readability and user comfort.

Intended Use:

This application serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking to enhance their spelling proficiency and expand their vocabulary. It is suitable for students, professionals, and lifelong learners, particularly those engaged with the technical domains represented in the specialized word lists. The software offers a structured, self-paced approach to spelling practice and vocabulary retention.
